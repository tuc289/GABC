# GABI (Genomic Analysis of Bacillus isolates)

### Genomic Analysis of Bacillus isolates 

#### This workflow is designed to compare between 

1. illumina based short-read whole genome sequencing data 
2. Oxford Nanopore (ONT) based whole genome sequencing data
3. hybrid assembly using both 1 and 2

* PSU HPC (aka ROAR) will be used for entire workflow

## Getting started

#### Initializing required bioinformatics tools to the conda environment 

#### Short-read WGS data assembly workflow (and required package or tools)

#### Long-read WGS data
